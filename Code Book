Initial Data

    Data file: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
    CodeBook: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The Data file contains the following:
	X files that contains the data from the activities both the test and the train data (main data files)
    y files that get the activities to each row on the X files
    subject: the subjects on which each row of X was measured
	labels> Features and activity_labels


Data load
	
    we load the following object from the raw data files
	X_test
	X_train
	Y_test
	Y_train
	subject_test
	subject_train
	
	
Transformation
	The activity labels are set as the names for teh columns
	The activities and subject are joined to the X files separately
    The X files are merged with an rbind preserving all columns mergeData
	mergeData is transformed into a data.table in myDT
	A subset of the columns with std and mean is performed and stored in myDTsubset
	
	Finally the result is teh aplication of the agreggate function on myDTsubset grouped by subject and activity
	The result is stored in myNewTidyData
	
	
	Te result is not written to disk automatically, you can do it from the workspace of R or add final lines to the script
